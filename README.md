I-am-not-dumb
=============
Don't wish it was easier, wish you were better.
Don't wish for less problems, wish for more skills.
Don't wish for less challenges, wish for more wisdom.

The major value in life is not what you get.
The major value in life is what you become.
Success is not to be pursued;
it is to be attracted by the person you become.

- Jim Rohn
